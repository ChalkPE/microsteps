# microsteps

A small javascript module build on top of [impress.js], to support step-wise content display within a slide.


### How to Use?

  - After loading the impressjs javascript file, load the microsteps.js file.

  - Add the class "microstep" to all the elements which you want to appear in steps.

  - By default, the microsteps will show up in the order it is present in the slide. In case, if you want to change the order,  add a data attribute "data-order"  to mention the order. For better understanding refer the last slide in the demo.html file.
